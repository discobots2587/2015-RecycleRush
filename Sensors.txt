Autonomous Closed Loop Drive:
At least one encoder on the drive train, one gyroscope.
note: If we use mecanum this is going to be nearly impossible because of slip.

Automatic (not autonomous) Robot Wall/Feeding Station Placement:
Two lidars on front corners facing front OR two sonars

Automatic (not autonomous) Stacking:
one lidar for lift facing front or one sonar, one encoder OR stringpot for lift, several buttons (intake, both plows, top of the lift, bottom of the lift)

Alternative viewport for driver:
One Camera, potentially lidars/sonars

Corrected sideways driving:
one gyroscope
